# Intro 

I woas wonderning if my sse Djanog streal using the [https://github.com/fanout/django-eventstream](django-eventstream) python module was working properly and was 
capable of handling multiple clients. So i made this little test script thta help us know if our sse server si working properly obvioulsy thta can be used for any sse server.

# How to use

1. Install the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script

```
To chnage the used argument you will need to edit the script itself.
